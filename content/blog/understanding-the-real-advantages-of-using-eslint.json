However, unlike compiled languages it is easy for syntax errors and accidental globals to creep into your code without realizing it until you actually try and run the code."

      "type": "paragraph",
      "content": "This is why I have made linting an important part of my daily workflow. Either as a gentle reminder in my editor of choice while working, and keeping an eye on me with every save. Or as part of my build process by notifying me of possible errors and bad practices that could cause unexpected results or crashes."

Even the most mindful developer can let things like this creep in without noticing. Having a tool to help keep you in check can be an invaluable asset."

It was first released in 2013, but I hadn't heard about it until recently. I was curious to know more. JSHint was serving my needs, so I wondered what ESLint could offer that other tools couldn't? It turns out, quite a bit."
